🚀 Project Idea: Automated Sales & Performance Analytics Dashboard with Email Reports
🔹 What It Does

Data Entry / Collection

Sales, customer, or operational data is logged into Google Sheets (manually, via Google Form, or imported from CSV/ERP).

Data Analytics in Sheets

Use formulas, pivot tables, and charts to analyze:

Daily/Monthly Sales trends 📈

Top Products/Regions 🏆

Customer Retention & Growth %

KPIs like Revenue, Profit Margin, Targets

Automated Email Reports

Every day/week/month, an Apps Script generates a summary report (key metrics, charts, insights).

Gmail automatically sends this report to:

Managers (summary KPIs)

Sales team (individual performance stats)

Customers (optional: invoices/acknowledgments).

Alerts & Notifications

If sales drop below a target → Gmail auto-sends alert.

If performance exceeds goal → sends “Congrats” mail.

🔹 Why It’s Great for Data Analytics

✅ Shows data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
✅ Demonstrates automation + reporting (a must in analytics jobs).
✅ Uses Google Sheets (analytics) + Gmail (delivery).
✅ Looks like a real BI (Business Intelligence) mini-project.

🔹 Resume-Ready Description

“Developed an automated sales analytics dashboard using Google Sheets with integrated Gmail reporting. Built pivot-based KPIs (monthly revenue, top products, target tracking) and automated email distribution of reports to management. Implemented alert notifications for performance anomalies, improving reporting efficiency and decision-making speed.”

🔹 Tech Skills You Can Claim

Google Sheets (Pivot Tables, Charts, Formulas)

Google Apps Script (automation, scheduling, MailApp)

Gmail API (email delivery)

Data Analytics concepts (KPIs, trends, reporting)

seee i will be making 1 project with only excel in which i had pick kargle data set for the excel project only and will do analytics with that then other with only sql 3 rd last project for reume in which i will use excel /google sheet +sql + if possible gmail so will it be fine and even planning to add portfoio link in which there will be other 3 projrct of only excel then of sql and then 1 more combined one so it it sufficient for google apprentship data anlaytics reume project

✅ Yes — your plan is more than sufficient for a Google Apprenticeship in Data Analytics, if you execute it properly and document it well.
Let’s break this down so you feel 100% confident 👇

🔹 Your Planned Projects

Excel Project (Kaggle Dataset)

Example: Sales / HR / Healthcare / Finance dataset.

You’ll do:

Cleaning (remove nulls, duplicates, format data).

Pivot tables, formulas.

Charts & Dashboard.

Shows: Data wrangling + visualization skills in Excel.

SQL Project (Only SQL)

Example: E-commerce or Banking dataset.

You’ll do:

Schema design (tables, relationships).

Data cleaning queries.

Advanced queries (window functions, KPIs).

Query optimization.

Shows: Strong SQL query writing + data modeling skills.

Combined Project (Excel/Google Sheets + SQL + Gmail)

Example:

Connect SQL data → clean in Power Query → Pivot Tables in Excel/Sheets.

Automate daily KPI email to stakeholders using Gmail / Apps Script.

Shows: Integration, automation, and applied analytics.

🔹 Extra Portfolio Projects

More Excel-only mini projects (like sales dashboard, employee analysis).

More SQL-only practice (e.g., customer churn analysis).

One more combined project (e.g., HR dashboard + Gmail reminder system).

👉 Together, this builds a balanced portfolio:

Excel for visualization

SQL for data handling

Integration project for automation

🔹 Why This is Sufficient for Google Apprenticeship

Google (and similar programs) look for:

Hands-on practice with real datasets ✅ You have Kaggle + SQL DB.

Core skills: Excel/Sheets, SQL, Analytics ✅ You’re covering all.

Problem solving with data ✅ Your projects have cleaning + analysis + insights.

Bonus: Automation / Integration ✅ You’re adding Gmail + Sheets/SQL combo.

Portfolio Proof ✅ GitHub / Portfolio website with documented projects.

This is exactly what recruiters want: not just tools, but applied analytics projects with clear business insights.

🔹 How to Present on Resume

Instead of just listing tools, describe impact:

“Built an Excel dashboard analyzing Kaggle HR dataset, identifying 3 key factors influencing attrition using pivot tables and trend analysis.”

“Designed SQL schema and queries for e-commerce dataset to calculate KPIs such as retention, revenue growth, and customer lifetime value.”

“Integrated SQL with Google Sheets and Gmail to automate weekly sales KPI email reports to stakeholders.”

✅ So yes — 3 main projects + 3 portfolio projects = very solid resume.
This will make you stand out because:

Many candidates only show Excel OR SQL, but you show both + integration.

You’ll have documented projects recruiters can check (portfolio link).

It matches exactly what data analysts do in real companies.
